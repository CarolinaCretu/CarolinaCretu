## Hi there 👋

My name is Carolina, and I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Genomics at the University of Bologna. I’m passionate about how biological data can be analyzed to uncover insights into the complexity of the human body.


## What I'm working on

💻 I'm currently tackling problems on the [Rosalind Platform](https://rosalind.info/about/), gaining hands-on experience with bioinformatics algorithms. You can check out my progress in this [repository](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/rosalind_solutions).

## Things unrelated to bioinformatics that also interest me
🌐 As a creative person, I've also explored web design. I built a custom portfolio website for my boyfriend, designing all the graphics myself. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/Website---Nicolo-Bramante) and visit his [website](https://nicolobramante.com/).

🧠 Learning and memory have always fascinated me. I struggled for a long time to find effective study techniques and understand the learning process— until I started researching and diving into scientific papers that explain these cognitive processes. To help others save time and find answers more easily, I’ve compiled everything I found into this [web page](). 

## Let's connect! 📫
