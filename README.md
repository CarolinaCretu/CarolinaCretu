##Hi there 👋

My name is Carolina, and I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Genomics at the University of Bologna. I'm passionate about bioinformatics and eager to explore how biological data can be analyzed in the field of cognitive genomics.

##Why cognition?

Learning and memory have always fascinated me. I struggled for a long time to find effective study techniques—until I started researching and diving into scientific papers that explain these cognitive processes. To help others save time and find answers more easily, I’ve compiled everything I found into this [web page]() to help annyone else struggling, like I did, find their answers. 

##What I'm working on

💻 I'm currently tackling problems on the [Rosalind Platform](https://rosalind.info/about/), gaining hands-on experience with bioinformatics algorithms. You can check out my progress in this [repository](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/rosalind_solutions).

🌐 As a creative person, I've also explored web design. Besides the web page dedicated to learning, I built a custom portfolio website for my boyfriend, designing all the graphics myself. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/Website---Nicolo-Bramante) and visit his [website](https://nicolobramante.com/).
