## Hi there 👋

My name is Carolina, and I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Genomics at the University of Bologna. I’m passionate about how biological data can be analyzed to uncover insights into the complexity of the human body and the natural world.


## How I'm learning bioinformatics 

💻 I'm currently solving problems on the [Rosalind Platform](https://rosalind.info/about/), gaining hands-on experience with bioinformatics algorithms. You can check out my progress in this [repository](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/rosalind_solutions).

💾 And [here](https://github.com/sntissera/Advanced-Programming-Project) is a recently completed project I worked on with a group of classmates as part of the final examination for the course 'Advanced Programming'. We created an application that, given FASTA sequences, can perform simple analyses based on the user's choice. My main contributions were on the front-end development side of the project, using Flask and HTML.

## Things unrelated to bioinformatics that also interest me
🌐 As a creative person, I've also explored web design. I built a custom portfolio website, designing all the graphics myself. You can find the [website](https://nicolobramante.com/) here. This was a great opportunity for me to learn about web deployment. 

🧠 Learning and memory have always fascinated me. I struggled for a long time to find effective study techniques and understand the learning process— until I started researching and diving into scientific papers that explain this cognitive process. To help others save time and find answers easier, I’ve compiled everything I found into this [web page]().
