## Hi there 👋

My name is Carolina, and I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Genomics at the University of Bologna. I'm passionate about bioinformatics and eager to explore how biological data can be analyzed in the field of cognitive genomics.

## Why cognition? 🧠

Learning and memory have always fascinated me. I struggled for a long time to find effective study techniques and understand the learning process— until I started researching and diving into scientific papers that explain these cognitive processes. To help others save time and find answers more easily, I’ve compiled everything I found into this [web page](). 

## What I'm working on

💻 I'm currently tackling problems on the [Rosalind Platform](https://rosalind.info/about/), gaining hands-on experience with bioinformatics algorithms. You can check out my progress in this [repository](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/rosalind_solutions).

## Things unrelated to cognitive genomics that also interest me 
🌐 As a creative person, I've also explored web design. Besides the [web page dedicated to learning](), I built a custom portfolio website for my boyfriend, designing all the graphics myself. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/Website---Nicolo-Bramante) and visit his [website](https://nicolobramante.com/).

😄 I've also founded a student association at my university with the goal of connecting all students interestesd in biotechnology from the different degrees. I created some tools we needed for the association such as email automation, data vizualization of the different members groups (such as the different degrees, years) and also a [newsletter archive](https://carolinacretu.github.io/student_association/). All these codes can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/student_association_tools).
To see more about the student association, NextGen BioTech, you can check you our [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/nextgenbiotech_fabit/).
