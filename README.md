## Hi there 👋

My name is Carolina and I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Genomics at the University of Bologna. I'm passionate about bioinformatics and eager to explore how biological data can be analyzed in the field of cognitive genomics.
Why cognition? Learning and memory have always fascinated me. I've struggled for a long time to find effective study techniques—until I started researching and diving into scientific papers that explain these cognitive processes. As a result, I’ve compiled everything I found into this [web page]() to save others some time and help them find their answers. 

- 💻 I’m currently working my way through the problems from the [Rosalind Platform](https://rosalind.info/about/), where I get to learn hands on about the different bioinformatics algorithms, you can check what I've done so far in this [repository](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/rosalind_solutions)

- 🌐 Since I am a creative person I've also tried my hand atweb design and besides the [web page dedicated to learning](), I made from scratch a portofolio for my boyfriend, with all custom graphics being drawn by me. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/CarolinaCretu/Website---Nicolo-Bramante) and this is his [website](https://nicolobramante.com/)
